# Phase 1m MML Coverage Report
# Project: D:\prod\simple_statistics
# Date: 2026-02-06
# Mode: spec-kit

## Collection Attributes Found
| Class | Attribute | Type | MML Type |
|-------|-----------|------|----------|
| REGRESSION_RESULT | residuals | ARRAY [REAL_64] | MML_SEQUENCE [REAL_64] |
| TEST_RESULT | assumption_checks | ARRAY [ASSUMPTION_CHECK] | MML_SEQUENCE [ASSUMPTION_CHECK] |

## Classes Scanned
| Class | Collection Attributes | Notes |
|-------|----------------------|-------|
| STATISTICS | (none) | Stateless facade; all operations take ARRAY parameters |
| CLEANED_STATISTICS | (none) | Stateless utility; returns new arrays |
| ASSUMPTION_CHECK | (none) | Immutable value object: name, passed, detail |
| REGRESSION_RESULT | residuals: ARRAY [REAL_64] | Immutable result object |
| TEST_RESULT | assumption_checks: ARRAY [ASSUMPTION_CHECK] | Immutable result object |

## Model Queries Added/Verified
| Class | Query | MML Type | Status |
|-------|-------|----------|--------|
| REGRESSION_RESULT | residuals_model | MML_SEQUENCE [REAL_64] | ADDED |
| TEST_RESULT | assumptions_model | MML_SEQUENCE [ASSUMPTION_CHECK] | ADDED |

## Contracts Strengthened
- Postconditions added/enriched: 0
- Preconditions added/enriched: 0
- Frame conditions added: 0
- Invariants added/enriched: 2 (REGRESSION_RESULT: model_count, TEST_RESULT: model_count)

## ECF
No changes needed - simple_mml dependency already present.

## Compilation
Command: /d/prod/ec.sh test -config simple_statistics.ecf -target simple_statistics_tests
Output: System Recompiled. C compilation completed.
Status: PASS (zero warnings)

## Tests
43/43 tests PASS

## Coverage Assessment
FULL

Both collection attributes mapped to MML_SEQUENCE with model queries and count-consistency invariants.
STATISTICS and CLEANED_STATISTICS are stateless (no attributes to model).
ASSUMPTION_CHECK has only scalar attributes (STRING, BOOLEAN) — no MML applicable.
Both result classes are immutable after creation — no commands to add frame conditions to.
