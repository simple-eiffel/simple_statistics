## Workflow Status

### Generated Files (READY)
✓ approach.md - Implementation strategy with 5-week plan
✓ prompts/phase2-ollama-review.md - Fully self-contained, ready to submit
✓ prompts/phase2-claude-review.md - Awaits Ollama response
✓ prompts/phase2-grok-review.md - Awaits Ollama + Claude responses
✓ prompts/phase2-gemini-review.md - Awaits all three responses

### Evidence Placeholders (EMPTY - PENDING USER INPUT)
□ evidence/phase2-ollama-response.md
□ evidence/phase2-claude-response.md
□ evidence/phase2-grok-response.md
□ evidence/phase2-gemini-response.md

## Contracts Reviewed

5 classes with 45+ features:
- STATISTICS (20 methods: descriptive, correlation, regression, hypothesis testing)
- TEST_RESULT (interpretation and formatting for test results)
- REGRESSION_RESULT (diagnostics, prediction, numerical stability)
- ASSUMPTION_CHECK (documenting test assumption validation)
- CLEANED_STATISTICS (data cleaning: remove NaN, infinite)

## Review Chain Progress

### Step 1: OLLAMA (Ready to submit)
Status: PENDING
Command: Copy entire file to Ollama and submit

### Step 2: CLAUDE (Waiting for Ollama)
Status: BLOCKED (awaits Ollama response)
Prerequisite: Phase 2-Ollama complete

### Step 3: GROK (Waiting for Ollama + Claude)
Status: BLOCKED (awaits previous responses)
Prerequisites: Phase 2-Ollama, Phase 2-Claude complete

### Step 4: GEMINI (Final synthesis)
Status: BLOCKED (awaits all previous responses)
Prerequisites: Phase 2-Ollama, Phase 2-Claude, Phase 2-Grok complete

## Contract Improvements Applied

✓ CRITICAL: Correlation range constraint added (-1.0 to 1.0)
✓ CRITICAL: Chi-square expected frequency precondition (>= 5.0)
✓ CRITICAL: ANOVA degrees of freedom postcondition
✓ HIGH: t_test_two_sample clarified (Welch's t-test)
✓ HIGH: min_value, max_value now verified in data
✓ HIGH: Trivial postconditions improved with documentation

All 15 identified issues addressed. System recompiled successfully.
