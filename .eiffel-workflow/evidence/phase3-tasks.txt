## Dependencies Identified

Critical Path (blocking):
- Distribution CDF functions (Tasks 18, 19, 20) must complete before hypothesis tests finalize

Dependency Groups:
- Group 1 (Foundation): Tasks 1-3 (no dependencies)
- Group 2 (Descriptive): Tasks 4-9 (depend on 1-2)
- Group 3 (Bivariate): Tasks 10-12 (depend on 2-5)
- Group 4 (Hypothesis): Tasks 13-17 (depend on previous + distribution CDFs)
- Group 5 (Utilities): Tasks 21-23 (optional/polish)

## Task Sizing

- Small tasks (0.5 day): 1, 3, 5, 8, 15, 23
- Medium tasks (1 day): 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 21, 22
- Large tasks (1.5+ days): 12, 17, 18, 19, 20

## Test Coverage

Each task references affected unit tests in TEST_STATISTICS:
- Task 1: (none - foundation only)
- Task 2: test_mean_single_value, test_mean_multiple_values, test_mean_negative_values
- Task 11: test_correlation_perfect_positive, test_correlation_in_range
- Task 12: test_linear_regression_simple, test_regression_result_predict
- Task 13: test_t_test_one_sample
- Task 14: test_t_test_two_sample
- Task 15: test_t_test_paired
- Task 16: test_chi_square_test
- Task 17: test_anova

Tests to be completed in Phase 5.

## Contracts Enforced

Each task includes postcondition verification:
- Descriptive stats: Non-negativity, range constraints, element membership
- Bivariate: Correlation in [-1, 1]
- Regression: R² in [0, 1]
- Hypothesis tests: p-value in [0, 1], dof constraints
- ANOVA: dof = groups.count - 1

## Critical Decisions

1. **Numerical Stability First**: All algorithms use stable variants
   - Welford's algorithm for mean/variance (not naive)
   - Kahan summation for sum (not naive float addition)
   - QR decomposition for regression (not normal equations)

2. **Distribution CDFs**: Deferred to Phase 5
   - Can use simple_probability if available
   - Or implement series approximation
   - Placeholder 0.5 acceptable for initial Task 13-17 structuring

3. **Assumption Checking**: Optional enhancement
   - Normality tests (Task 22)
   - Equal variance tests
   - Populated in test result objects

4. **Data Cleaning**: Utility task
   - Not required for core functionality
   - Can defer to Phase 5 if needed

## Human Approval

Status: PENDING - Awaiting user approval
